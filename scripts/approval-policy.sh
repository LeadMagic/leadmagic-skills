# PreToolUse approval policy for LeadMagic MCP tools (mcp__plugin_leadmagic_leadmagic__*
# from this plugin, mcp__leadmagic__* when the server was added by hand).
#
# Auto-approves every LeadMagic tool except ASK_BEFORE_TOOLS, which still prompt
# because they queue paid jobs, start paid runs, move data in or out of connected
# systems, or delete. Emits no decision at all (Claude Code's normal permission
# flow) when stdin cannot be parsed, the tool is not a LeadMagic tool, or
# LEADMAGIC_ASK_ALL=1 is set.
#
# Contract: the ASK_BEFORE_TOOLS array is parsed by
# lm-tui/tests/unit/plugin-approval-policy.test.ts and mirrored by the Claude Code
# permissions snippet on app.leadmagic.io (Settings -> API -> AI tooling). One
# "tool:group" entry per line, double-quoted, sorted. Groups: bulk | run | import |
# push | delete.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS /bin/bash): no associative arrays, no lowercasing.
